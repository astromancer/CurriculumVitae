# CurriculumVitae

I'm a published researcher in the field of astrophysics with a passion for data
science and data visualization. I am currently completing my MSc in astrophysics
at University of Cape Town (UCT) and expect to graduate in December 2024. 

I'm a proficient full stack python developer with 12 years of coding experience
and contributions to a number of open-source scientific computing and
visualization libraries. I am passionate about open source and have authored and
maintain a number of software libraries for applications in astronomy. I have
extensive experience in statistical model building and using machine learning to
gain valuable insights into data. I have participated in, and later led
independent research into developing machine learning models for predicting the
onset of seizures in patients suffering from epilepsy using EEG data. 

My main hobbies are outdoor adventure sports such as rock-climbing and
high-lining, and I have led- and participated in numerous international
expeditions to remote mountainous regions on earth.
