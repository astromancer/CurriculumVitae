     abstract = "{We report the discovery of a new eclipsing polar, MASTER OT
        J061451.70-272535.5, detected as an optical transient by MASTER
        auto-detection software at the recently commissioned MASTER-SAAO
        telescope. Time resolved (10-20 s) photometry with the SAAO
        1.9-m and 1.0-m telescopes, utilizing the SHOC EM-CCD cameras,
        revealed that the source eclipses, with a period of 2.08 h
        (7482.9{\ensuremath{\pm}} 3.5 s). The eclipse light curve has a
        peculiar morphology, comprising an initial dip, where the source
        brightness drops to 50 per cent of the pre-eclipse level before
        gradually increasing again in brightness. A second rapid ingress
        follows, where the brightness drops by 60-80 per cent, followed
        by a more gradual decrease to zero flux. We interpret the
        eclipse profile as the result of an initial obscuration of the
        accretion hot-spot on the magnetic white dwarf by the accretion
        stream, followed by an eclipse of both the hotspot and partially
        illuminated stream by the red dwarf donor star. This is similar
        to what has been observed in other eclipsing polars such as HU
        Aqr, but here the stream absorption is more pronounced. The
        object was subsequently observed with South African Large
        Telescope (SALT) using the Robert Stobie Spectrograph (RSS).
        This revealed a spectrum with all of the Balmer lines in
        emission, a strong He II 4686 {\r{A}} line with a peak flux
        greater than that of H{\ensuremath{\beta}}, as well as weaker He
        I lines. The spectral features, along with the structure of the
        light curve, suggest MASTER OT J061451.70-272535.5 is a new
        magnetic cataclysmic variable, most likely of the synchronized
        Polar subclass.}",
