        dominated by their secondary stars, which we classify
        approximately as K4 and M0.5, respectively. Their orbital
        periods, determined mostly from the secondary
        stars{\textquoteright} radial velocities, proved to be nearly
        identical, respectively 350.14 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.15 and
        348.25 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.60 minutes. The
        H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission line in V1062 Cyg displays a
        relatively sharp emission component that tracks the
        secondary{\textquoteright}s motion, which may arise on the
        irradiated face of the secondary; this is not often seen and may
        indicate an unusually strong flux of ionizing radiation. Both
        systems exhibit double-peaked orbital modulation consistent with
        ellipsoidal variation from the changing aspect of the secondary.
        We model these variations to constrain the orbital inclination
        i, and estimate approximate component masses based on i and the
        secondary velocity amplitude K $_{2}$.}",

        observations to test the two-planet model previously proposed to
        explain the variations in its eclipse times measured over the
        past 35 yr. We find that the proposed model does indeed follow
        the general trend of the new eclipse times, however, there are
        significant departures. In order to accommodate the new eclipse
        times, the two-planet model requires that one or both of the
        planets require highly eccentric orbits, that is, e
        {\ensuremath{\geq}} 0.4. Such multiple planet orbits are
        considered to be unstable. Whilst our new observations are
        consistent with two cyclic variations as previously predicted,
        significant residuals remain. We conclude that either additional
        cyclic terms, possibly associated with more planets, or other
        mechanisms, such as the Applegate mechanism are contributing to
        the eclipse time variations. Further long-term monitoring is

to be either a pre-polar or an asynchronous polar. <BR /> Aims: We
conducted follow-up optical observations to identify the sources and
periods of variability precisely and to classify this X-ray source
correctly. <BR /> Methods: Extensive multicolor photometric and medium-
to high-resolution spectroscopy observations were performed and period
search codes were applied to sort out the complex variability of the
object. <BR /> Results: We found firm evidence of discording
spectroscopic (81.29 {\plusmn} 0.01 m) and photometric (83.599 {\plusmn}
0.002 m) periods that we ascribe to the white dwarf (WD) spin period and
binary orbital period, respectively. This confirms that IGR J19552+0044
is an asynchronous polar. Wavelength dependent variability and its
continuously changing shape point at a cyclotron emission from a
magnetic WD with a relatively low magnetic field below 20 MG. <BR />
Conclusions: The difference between the WD spin period and the binary
orbital period proves that IGR J19552+0044 is a polar with the largest
known degree of asynchronism (0.97 or 3\%).

the Centaur object (10199) Chariklo during a stellar occultation
observed on 2013 June 3. Following this discovery, we planned
observations of several occultations by Chariklo{\rsquo}s system in order
to better characterize the physical properties of the ring and main
body. Here, we use 12 successful occulations by Chariklo observed
between 2014 and 2016. They provide ring profiles (physical width,
opacity, edge structure) and constraints on the radii and pole position.
Our new observations are currently consistent with the circular ring
solution and pole position, to within the {\plusmn}3.3 km formal
uncertainty for the ring radii derived by Braga-Ribas et al. The six
resolved C1R profiles reveal significant width variations from {\tilde}5 to
7.5 km. The width of the fainter ring C2R is less constrained, and may
vary between 0.1 and 1 km. The inner and outer edges of C1R are
consistent with infinitely sharp boundaries, with typical upper limits
of one kilometer for the transition zone between the ring and empty
space. No constraint on the sharpness of C2R{\rsquo}s edges is available.
A 1{$\sigma$}  upper limit of {\tilde}20 m is derived for the equivalent width
of narrow (physical width $\lt$ 4 km) rings up to distances of 12,000 km,
counted in the ring plane.

 abstract = "{We use data from five stellar occultations observed between 2013 and
2016 to constrain Chariklo{\rsquo}s size and shape, and the ring
reflectivity. We consider four possible models for Chariklo (sphere,
Maclaurin spheroid, triaxial ellipsoid, and Jacobi ellipsoid), and we
use a Bayesian approach to estimate the corresponding parameters. The
spherical model has a radius R = 129 {\plusmn} 3 km. The Maclaurin model
has equatorial and polar radii a=b=$\{$143$\}$$_{-6}$$^{+3}$ $\{$km$\}$
and c=$\{$96$\}$$_{-4}$$^{+14}$ $\{$km$\}$, respectively, with density
$\{$970$\}$$_{-180}$$^{+300}$ $\{$kg$\}$ $\{$$\{$$\{$m$\}$$\}$$\}$$^{-3}$. The
ellipsoidal model has semiaxes a=$\{$148$\}$$_{-4}$$^{+6}$ $\{$km$\}$,
b=$\{$132$\}$$_{-5}$$^{+6}$ $\{$km$\}$, and
c=$\{$102$\}$$_{-8}$$^{+10}$ $\{$km$\}$. Finally, the Jacobi model has
semiaxes a = 157 {\plusmn} 4 km, b = 139 {\plusmn} 4 km, and c = 86
{\plusmn} 1 km, and density $\{$796$\}$$_{-4}$$^{+2}$ $\{$kg$\}$
$\{$$\{$$\{$m$\}$$\}$$\}$$^{-3}$. Depending on the model, we obtain topographic
features of 6-11 km, typical of Saturn icy satellites with similar
size and density. We constrain Chariklo{\rsquo}s geometric albedo between
3.1\% (sphere) and 4.9\% (ellipsoid), while the ring I/F reflectivity is
less constrained between 0.6\% (Jacobi) and 8.9\% (sphere). The ellipsoid
model explains both the optical light curve and the long-term photometry
variation of the system, giving a plausible value for the geometric
albedo of the ring particles of 10\%-15\%. The derived mass of
Chariklo of 6-8 {\times} 10$^{18}$ kg places the rings close
to 3:1 resonance between the ring mean motion and Chariklo{\rsquo}s
rotation period.

 abstract = "{Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) of a few seconds have been detected
in some polars, the synchronised subclass of cataclysmic systems
containing a strongly magnetised white dwarf which accretes matter from
a red dwarf companion. The QPOs are thought to be related to
instabilities of a shock formed in the accretion column, close to the
white dwarf photosphere above the impact region. We present optical
observations of the polar V834 Centauri performed with the fast ULTRACAM
camera mounted on the ESO-VLT simultaneously in three filters (u', He II
{$\lambda$}4686, r') to study these oscillations and characterise their
properties along the orbit when the column is seen at different viewing
angles. Fast Fourier transforms and wavelet analysis have been performed
and the mean frequency, rms amplitude, and coherence of the QPOs are
derived; a detailed inspection of individual pulses has also been
performed. The observations confirm the probable ubiquity of the QPOs
for this source at all epochs when the source is in a high state, with
observed mean amplitude of 2.1\% (r'), 1.5\% (He II), and 0.6\% (u'). The
QPOs are present in the r' filter at all phases of the orbital cycle,
with a higher relative amplitude around the maximum of the light curve.
They are also detected in the He II and u' filters but at a lower level.
Trains of oscillations are clearly observed in the r' light curve and
can be mimicked by a superposition of damped sinusoids with various
parameters. The QPO energy distribution is comparable to that of the
cyclotron flux, consistent for the r' and He II filters but requiring a
significant dilution in the u' filter. New 1D hydrodynamical simulations
of shock instabilities, adapted to the physical parameters of
<ASTROBJ>V834 Cen</ASTROBJ>, can account for the optical QPO amplitude
and X-ray upper limit assuming a cross section of the accretion column
in the range  (4 - 5) {\times} 10$^{14}$ cm$^{2}$. However,
the predicted frequency is larger than the observed one by an order of
magnitude. This shortcoming indicates that the QPO generation is more
complex than that produced in a homogeneous column and calls for a more
realistic 3D treatment of the accretion flow in future modelling.
