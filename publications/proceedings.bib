     abstract = "{Magnetic cataclysmic variables (mCVs) present a host of opportunities
        for time-resolved studies of accretion dominated by magnetic
        fields. Since their initial discovery by virtue of X-ray
        emission, they have been subject to multi-wavelength studies
        which have continued to reveal new insights. Here we review the
        role of high time resolution optical observations of mCVs and
        discuss how these have impacted on our understanding of the
        accretion processes at work. Recent work by us has included the
        search for observations of QPOs, which would appear to be rarer
        than initially thought. Polarimetry has always been a crucial
        tool to unlock the nature of the accreting magnetic white dwarfs
        in these systems and recent results in this area will also be
        presented.}",
